# HR-Analytics---Predicting-employee-Attrition
Human Resources are critical resources of any organization. Organizations spend huge amount of time and money to hire and nurture their employees. It is a huge loss for companies if employees leave, especially the key resources. So if HR can predict weather employees are at risk for leaving the company, it will allow them to identify the attrition risks and help understand and provide necessary support to retain those employees or do preventive hiring to minimize the impact to the organization. Predictive retention modeling allows organizations to identify high-risk employees, build profiles of those most likely to leave or stay, and understand how risk is distributed throughout the organization. Several innovative large organizations have started building these kind of HR analytics with great success in the past 􀇇ears 􀍾e.g. Google, HP,…􀍿. Ne􀇆t to the traditional HRIS dashboard with descriptive turnover information, we see more and more companies adding these predictive turnover information to their standard reporting.
